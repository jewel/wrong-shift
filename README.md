Wrong Shift
===========

Small ruby script to annoy the user when he or she uses the
"incorrect" shift key when touch-typing a capital letter.

It works on Linux running X11 and assumes a US qwerty keyboard layout.
On Debian derivatives it needs the "xinput" and "x11-server-utils"
packages installed.

Instead of a terminal bell, the source code could be modified to play
a sound and set to run on startup.
